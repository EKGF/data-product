- [DQV](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dqv/) is a standard vocabulary to describe data quality and is proposed along with the DCAT vocabulary to measure the quality of datasets.
- It is based on 3 basic entities: Dimensions, the Metrics that belong to its dimension, and the Measurement for each metric.
- Data Quality can be computed at different levels, eg. data product, dataset, table, column level etc. 
- Usually, data quality metrics are measured at a dataset level and can inform more higher-level quality metrics at a data product level.
