An Observability Port is a designated interface or endpoint in a system or application specifically used for monitoring and diagnostic purposes. It allows external tools or services to collect and analyze data related to the system's performance, health, and behaviour. By exposing metrics, logs, and traces through this port, administrators and developers can gain insights into the system's state, troubleshoot issues, and ensure it operates efficiently and reliably.

DPROD has a schema-first design, to the first thing you would need to do is define an schema for your logging information. It could be a schema based on open telemetry etc, but in this example we use RLOG (which is a semantic ontology for logging).

If I want to find the Observability Port then I would query the ports to find the ones that returned an RLOG:Entry:
```sparql
PREFIX dcat: <http://www.w3.org/ns/dcat#>
PREFIX dprod: <https://ekgf.github.io/data-product-spec/dprod/>
PREFIX rlog: <http://persistence.uni-leipzig.org/nlp2rdf/ontologies/rlog#>

SELECT ?port
WHERE
{ 
  ?port a dcat:DataService .
  ?port (dprod:isAccessServiceOf/dprod:isDistributionOf)/dcat:conformsTo rlog:Entry
}
```

This query will return the URI: https://y.com/uk-bonds/observability-port
