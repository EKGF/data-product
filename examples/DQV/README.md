DQV is a standard vocabulary to describe data quality and is proposed along with the DCAT vocabulary to measure the quality of Datasets
It is based on 3 basic entities, Categories, the Metrics that belong to its category, and the Measurement for each metric
Data Quality can be computed in different levels, eg. data product, dataset, table, column level etc. 
Usually, data quality metrics are measured in Dataset level and can inform more high level quality metrics on data product level
