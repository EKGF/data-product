<h1 id="title">Data Product Vocabulary (DPROD)</h1>

<section id='abstract'>
  <p>
  The concept of Data Products has emerged as organizations increasingly recognize
  the value of data as an asset to be managed and distributed like any other product. 
  As more companies adopt decentralized data architectures, such as Data Mesh,
  the need for standardized methods to describe and manage data products consistently 
  across platforms has become critical. 
  This is where the DPROD specification, built on W3C Linked Data standards, becomes essential. 
  Without such a standard, organizations face significant challenges: 
  inconsistent metadata across diverse data products, limited discoverability, 
  and interoperability issues that hinder data integration from various sources. 
  As data ecosystems grow, the lack of a common framework also impedes scalability, 
  increases vendor lock-in, and makes it difficult to manage these products effectively.
  </p>
  <p>
  DPROD offers a solution by providing a clear schema for describing data products, 
  ensuring they are discoverable, interoperable, and treated with the same level of 
  accountability as traditional products.
  </p>
  <p>
  The W3C tech stack is perfectly suited to address these challenges because it was 
  designed to foster interconnected, decentralized systems, providing a robust framework 
  for creating metadata that is both machine-readable and human-understandable. 
  DPROD enables consistent terminology across different platforms, domains, and organizations, 
  allowing advanced users to semantically enrich their data products and connect 
  them into distributed knowledge graphs.
  </p>
  <p>
  As more organizations strive to build and scale data products, 
  DPROD provides the standardization needed to ensure interoperability and unlock 
  the full potential of decentralized data ecosystems in a controlled and mature way.
  </p>

</section>

<section>
  <h2>Scope</h2>
  <p>
    The <a href="https://ekgf.github.io/dprod/dprod.ttl">Data Product (DPROD)</a> specification is a
    profile of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/">Data Catalog (DCAT) Vocabulary</a>,
    designed to describe Data Products.
    This document defines the schema and provides examples for its use.
  </p>
  <p>
    DPROD extends DCAT to enable publishers to describe Data Products and data services in a decentralized way.
    By using a standard model and vocabulary, DPROD facilitates the consumption and aggregation of metadata
    from multiple Data Marketplaces.
    This approach increases the discoverability of products and services, supports decentralized data publishing,
    and enables federated search across multiple sites using a uniform query mechanism and structure.
  </p>
  <p>
    The namespace for DPROD terms is <a href="https://ekgf.github.io/dprod/#">https://ekgf.github.io/dprod/#</a>
  </p>
  <p>
    The suggested prefix for the DPROD namespace is <strong><code>dprod</code></strong>
  </p>

  <p><strong>DPROD follows two basic principles:</strong></p>
  <ul class="blue-balls">
    <li>
      Decentralize Data Ownership: To make data integration more efficient, tasks should be shared among multiple
      teams. DCAT helps by offering a standard way to publish datasets in a decentralized manner.
    </li>
    <li>
      Harmonize Data Schemas: Using shared schemas helps unify different data formats.
      For instance, the <a href="https://ekgf.github.io/dprod/dprod.ttl">DPROD</a> specification provides a
      common set of rules for defining a <a href="#dataproduct">Data Product</a>.
      You can extend this schema as needed.
    </li>
  </ul>

  The DPROD specification builds on DCAT by connecting
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Data_Service">DCAT Data Services</a> to
  DPROD <a href="#dataproduct">Data Products</a> using <a href="#inputport">Input</a> and
  <a href="#outputport">output</a> ports.
  These ports are used to publish and consume data from a Data Product.
  DPROD treats ports as <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Data_Service">dcat data services</a>,
  so the data exchanged can be described using DCAT's highly expressive metadata around
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Distribution">distributions</a> and
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Dataset">datasets</a>.
  This approach also allows you to create your own descriptions for the data you are sharing.
  You can use a special property called
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:resource_conforms_to">conformsTo</a> from DCAT to link to
  your own set of rules or guidelines for your data.

  <p><strong>The DPROD specification has four main aims:</strong></p>
  <ul class="blue-balls">
    <li>
      To provide unambiguous and sharable semantics to answer the question: 'What is a <a href="#dataproduct">data
      product</a>?'
    </li>
    <li>
      Be simple for anyone to use, but expressive enough to power large data marketplaces
    </li>
    <li>
      Allow organisations to reuse their existing data catalogues and dataset infrastructure
    </li>
    <li>
      To share common semantics across different Data Products and promote harmonization
    </li>
  </ul>

<section>
  <h2>Data Product (DPROD) Model</h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mesh">Data Mesh Architectures</a> use input and output ports to manage
    how data enters and leaves a Data Product. These ports can handle different formats, schemas, and protocols. Input
    ports bring in data, while output ports send data to other Data Products for aggregation, reuse, analysis or
    reporting etc.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the Data Catalog Vocabulary (DCAT) framework, 
    a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:DataService">Data Service</a> is a way 
    to describe services that provide access to data. 
    Data Services give standardized, machine-readable descriptions of how to access one or more 
    datasets or data processing functions.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data Services specify how to access and download the data. In DPROD Data Services are connected to <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Distribution">Distributions</a> by a property called <a
    href="#isaccessserviceof">isAccessServiceOf</a>, on the Distribution you can specify formats (like CSV or JSON etc)
    and provide metadata about the "physical model" of the data. Distributions link to <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Dataset">Datasets</a> and DCAT has a very rich vocabulary for
    describing every aspect of your dataset. Finally, Datasets use the <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:resource_conforms_to">conformsTo</a> property to link to the
    "logical model" where you can specify rich semantic metadata of your own.
  </p>
  <p>
    By linking Data Product ports to DCAT DataServices, DPROD can describe Data Products in a way that machines can read
    across the organization. This makes it easier for data teams to build and manage their own data products
    independently, while still working well with the rest of the organization's data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Using standards like DCAT helps create a strong and clear way to define Data Products. It ensures that as data
    becomes more complex, the methods for describing, sharing, and using data stay consistent and reliable. It also
    allows different organizations to share data securely and in a standardized way.

  <p>
    The Profile consists of the following classes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data Mesh (<code>dcat:Catalog</code>) - The collection of Data Products
      </li>
      <li>
        Data Product (<code>dprod:DataProduct</code>) - A data product may have input and output ports, code and
        metadata
      </li>
      <li>
        Port (<code>dcat:DataService</code>) - A digital interface that provides access to a Dataset. The can be a HTTP
        URL, a Database or a FileShare etc
      </li>
      <li>
        Distribution (<code>dcat:Distribution</code>) - A specific representation of a dataset (CSV, JSON, ADLS etc)
        which can conform to a physical model
      </li>
      <li>
        Dataset (<code>dcat:Dataset</code>) - A collection of related data that can conform to a logical model
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    As <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Data_Service">DCAT Data Services</a>, the DPROD <a
    href="#inputport">input</a> and <a href="#outputport">output</a> ports can specify connection details, they have <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Distribution">distributions</a> that define formats, and link to <a
    href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Class:Dataset">datasets</a> that conform to shared schemas. In this
    example,
    the UK Bonds Data Product includes an output port, which is a RESTful API. This API delivers JSON data conforming to
    the shared FIBO specification for callable bonds.

  <p class="note">
    The examples in map the type of the above classes to <code>@type</code> in the JSON-LD serializations.
    You can use JSON-LD to extend the familiar JSON syntax with the shared semantics defined by DCAT and DPROD.
    <br/>
    You can copy the json above and paste it into <a
    href="https://json-ld.org/playground/">https://json-ld.org/playground</a>.
    You can see that the schema resolves.
