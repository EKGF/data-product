# DPROD Ontology

Repository for the Data Products Ontology (DPROD), a proposed OMG standard, originally created by the EKGF Data Product Workgroup.
The proposal is currently under industry review until December 2024, and until that time the main branch is locked.
Any changes will occur on the develop branch so pull requests should be targeted at that.

- [Examples / Test Cases](examples/README.md)
- [Ontologies](ontology/README.md)
- [Concepts](concept/README.md)

The specification is generated by a Python module called `spec-generator`
using the W3C Respec template (a fork of it) and (temporarily) published
here: https://ekgf.github.io/dprod
