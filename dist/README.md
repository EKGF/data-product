# Distribution Directory

This directory contains all the files that make up the website https://ekgf.github.io/dprod/. 

There are 3 ways to build this website:

1. Use './build.sh' (a Bash script in the root directory of this repositoru) to build the website.
2. Or push changes to the 'main' branch to trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that will build the website. (Only for code owners)
3. Create a pull request and get it approved which will trigger the same GitHub Actions workflow as described in the previous point.
